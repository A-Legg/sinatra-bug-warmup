# Debugging Sinatra Warmup

## The Bug

We just received an email from an unhappy client:

```
I keep getting emails from users saying that they can't create accounts! What is going on???
I need this fixed NOW!!!!!1!
```

The note isn't very helpful. We have tried to reach out to the client but they aren't responding.
Can you look into this?
